This app can be ran on Android mobile devices.
The goal was to have an admin side that can generate QR codes using a description,
and user side that can scan the QR codes to view the associated descriptions.

A database has NOT been set up yet to store the generated QR codes,
due to a time constraint.
That feature will be coming in a future update.
